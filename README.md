# Neuro_Play

Neuro_play (N_p) is a sub-intiative / program derived from an avant-garde social media application based in San Francisco. N_p in particular focuses on the acquisition of user-submitted and user-reviewed multi-modal data (text, tonality, video, social media presence, background information, genomic profile) and manipulates the data using NLP, sentiment analysis, and geometric deep learning approaches to generate user-compliant synthetic data of various modalities).

As of 2023-2024 season, we are perfecting our NLPCA approach, which aims to derive more salient utility from as little data as possible (text). NLPCA is generalizable to other modalities. The end goal is several-fold: user-data interaction & data-autonomy, neuropsychological therapeutics for well-being and physical health optimization, user-togglable self-surveillance protocols, applications in the Japanese field known as Telexistence, and digital twin synthesis.

All data is confidential and under closed-source user-proprietorship. Anything you may or may not view in this repository is synthetic data derived from my own multi-modal transcripts, blood work, and other analyses.
